# Personal-Loan-Campaign-Machine-Learning
This project aims to identify bank customers with a high likelihood of purchasing a loan. By analyzing customer data, we explore key attributes influencing loan acquisition and build a predictive model to help the bank target potential buyers more effectively—boosting marketing efficiency and conversion rates.


# 🏦 Loan Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to identify bank customers with a high likelihood of purchasing a loan. By analyzing customer data, we explore key attributes influencing loan acquisition and build a predictive model to help the bank target potential buyers more effectively—boosting marketing efficiency and conversion rates.

## 🧠 Skills & Tools Covered
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Machine Learning Model Building (Decision Tree)
- Model Evaluation and Optimization
- Business Recommendations

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographic and behavioral information provided by the bank. Features may include:
- Age, job, marital status, education
- Contact type, duration, campaign history
- Previous loan status, and more

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **EDA**: Understand distributions, correlations, and trends in data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize data, etc.
3. **Model Building**: Train a Decision Tree classifier to predict loan purchase.
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
5. **Improvement**: Fine-tune model using hyperparameters and pruning.
6. **Recommendations**: Provide business insights for targeted loan marketing.
